# Notes: March 27, 2020
The dependency expression language I was working on earlier confuses entity resolution and actual dependency edges, at least for directory accesses. By that, I mean that when a command accesses the path `/tmp/`, it should get whatever the latest version of that directory is, not just a lookup operation. If command A creates a file in that directory, then command B accesses that file, we'd expect command B to depend on the version of the directory created by command A. That wasn't captured before, so I'll be updating the expression langauge today, and hopefully get a start on using that langauge to output real dependency information from traced builds.
