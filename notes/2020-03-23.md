# Notes: March 23, 2020
Picking up where I left off on Friday, I've made a few decisions:

1. Dependencies on paths will be tracked recursively from the root directory.
2. Operations on paths (e.g. creating, renaming, and unlinking) will be modifications to the containing directory.
3. Dependency edges will be pushed up to the earliest-possible version. This avoids creating serialized operations on directories that are actually independent. Dependencies that fall off the earliest version become pre-build dependencies.

There are a few questions that come to mind:

**What do we do with relative paths?** 
The easiest approach is to convert them to absolute paths. Do we lose anything by doing that? Maybe not, since commands can and do convert relative paths to absolute paths before making syscalls. Let's assume we always convert them to absolute paths.

**How do we order versions?** 
Moving dependencies earlier means that file and path versions are no longer totally ordered. That seems okay (good, even) but what is the best way to show that in the build graph? We want it to be clear because that's currently the only mechanism for checking the accuracy of the tracing operations. Some kind of happens-before graph of versions seems reasonable. Getting graphviz to lay these out close together will be interesting, but should be possible with edge weights.
