# Notes: April 2, 2020
Today we are trying to implement the tracing/rerunning logic we discussed yesterday. We'll only support the ABbuild test to start.

Syscalls we need to handle to run the ABbuild example:
- `execve`
- `access`
  - DONE
- `openat`
  - DONE
- `fstat`
- `mmap`
- `close`
- `read`
- `fcntl`
- `clone`
- `stat`
- `dup2`
- `write`
